There is no count of the peaks above 5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the [eight-thousanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-thousanders "Eight-thousanders")) are in Pakistan (four of which lie in the surroundings of [Concordia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_(Karakoram) "Concordia (Karakoram)"); the confluence of [Baltoro Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltoro_Glacier "Baltoro Glacier") and [Godwin Austen Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin_Austen_Glacier "Godwin Austen Glacier")). Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the [Karakoram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakoram "Karakoram") mountain range (which lies almost entirely in the [Gilgit–Baltistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgit%E2%80%93Baltistan "Gilgit–Baltistan") region of Pakistan, and is considered to be a part of the greater [Himalayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalaya "Himalaya") range) but some peaks above 7,000 m are included in the [Himalayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalaya "Himalaya") and [Hindu Kush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush "Hindu Kush") ranges. Moreover, Pakistan is home to over 7,000 [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciers "Glaciers"), more than anywhere except the polar regions.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_in_Pakistan#cite_note-1)*
