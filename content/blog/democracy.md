**Democracy** ([Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): δημοκρατία, *dēmokratiā*, from *dēmos* 'people' and *kratos* 'rule') is a form of [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government "Government") in which [the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People "People") have the [authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority "Authority") to choose their governing [legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislation "Legislation"). Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic theory, development and [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Constitution"). Some cornerstones of these issues are [freedom of assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly "Freedom of assembly") and [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech"), [inclusiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion "Social exclusion") and [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_equality "Political equality"), [membership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship "Citizenship"), [consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed "Consent of the governed"), [voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_rights "Voting rights"), [right to life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life "Right to life") and [minority rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights "Minority rights").

##### Generally, there are two types of democracy: direct and representative. In a [direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy"), the people directly [deliberate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberate "Deliberate") and decide on [legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature "Legislature"). In a [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy"), the people elect representatives to deliberate and decide on legislature, such as in [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_democracy "Parliamentary democracy") or [presidential democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_democracy "Presidential democracy"). [Liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy "Liquid democracy") combines elements of these two basic types. However, the noun "democracy" has, over time, been modified by more than 3,500 adjectives which suggests that it may have types that can elude and elide this duality.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#cite_note-1)\
